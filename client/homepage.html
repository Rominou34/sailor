    <h3>What is this ?</h3>
    <p>
      Sailor is a PWA used to monitor and manage your Digital Ocean
      account and droplets.<br/>
      It runs using only PHP for the back-end, and creates the front-end using
      AngularJS ( not Angular 2 ).<br/>
      It's still in very early development so it doesn't do much for now
    </p>

    <h3>What's the point ?</h3>
    <p>
      I don't develop this webapp in order to gain fame or anything like that,
      I'm just doing it in order to learn new things.<br/>
      In fact, I'm going to use AngularJS to create the front-end of a webapp
      running on PHP during my internship, so the development of Sailor is
      going to help me a lot, and that's the main reason behind it.
